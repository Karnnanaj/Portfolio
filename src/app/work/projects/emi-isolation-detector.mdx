## Overview

Developed a comprehensive EMI (Electromagnetic Interference) isolation system for balanced homodyne detectors used in quantum optics experiments. Successfully isolated the detector output from environmental interference, achieving a 13 dB improvement in noise floor performance.

## Problem Statement

Balanced photodetectors are sensitive precision instruments prone to electromagnetic interference from surrounding equipment. The initial setup suffered from noise floor of -55 dBm, severely limiting the detector's sensitivity and measurement capability for quantum optics experiments that require operation at shot-noise levels.

## Key Achievements

- **13 dB Noise Improvement**: Reduced noise floor from -55 dBm to -68 dBm (approaching shot-noise limit)
- **5 GHz Bandwidth Protection**: Complete EMI shielding across operational frequency range
- **Passive and Active Filtering**: Multi-layer approach combining Faraday cages, shielded cables, and active feedback
- **Low Latency Design**: Maintained fast detector response while achieving high noise immunity
- **Reproducible Performance**: Documented procedures for replicating results in similar setups

## Technical Implementation

### Shielding Strategy
- **Primary Shielding**: Mu-metal Faraday cage for magnetic field attenuation
- **Secondary Shielding**: Copper mesh enclosures for electromagnetic field rejection
- **Cable Management**: Shielded twisted-pair cables with proper grounding techniques
- **RF Filtering**: Ferrite cores and LC filters for high-frequency rejection

### Filtering Architecture
- **Analog Filtering**: Low-noise Op-amp based filters at detector output
- **Power Supply Filtering**: Multiple LC filter stages for power line noise rejection
- **AC Decoupling**: Transformer isolation for RF interference prevention
- **Frequency-Selective Rejection**: Notch filters for specific interference frequencies

### Grounding and Bonding
- **Star Grounding**: Central grounding point to eliminate ground loops
- **Impedance Matching**: Proper transmission line termination to prevent reflections
- **Frequency-Dependent Grounding**: Separate grounding paths for different frequency ranges
- **Low-Inductance Connections**: Minimized loop area for signal returns

## Performance Optimization
