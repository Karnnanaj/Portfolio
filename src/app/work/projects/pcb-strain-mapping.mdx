## Overview

Developing an innovative full-field strain mapping methodology for printed circuit boards using Digital Image Correlation (DIC) combined with laser speckle analysis. This technique enables comprehensive characterization of mechanical and thermal stresses across entire PCB surfaces, providing unprecedented insight into component behavior under operating conditions.

## Motivation

Traditional strain measurement techniques (strain gauges, FEA simulation) provide only point-wise data or theoretical predictions. Full-field strain mapping captures the complete spatial stress distribution, enabling:
- Identification of stress concentration zones
- Validation of finite element models
- Optimization of PCB layout and component placement
- Early detection of potential failure points
- Real-time thermal stress characterization

## Technical Implementation

### Digital Image Correlation (DIC)

**Principle:**
- Compares sequential images of the PCB surface
- Tracks movement of natural or applied speckle patterns
- Calculates strain from pixel displacement data
- Provides full-field strain tensor information

**Setup Components:**
- High-resolution industrial camera (`5+ MP`)
- Dantec Dynamics DIC measurement equipment
- Precision lighting for consistent speckle contrast
- Temperature-controlled test chamber
- Data acquisition and analysis software

### Laser Speckle Analysis

**Advantages:**
- Non-contact measurement technique
- Laser speckle provides inherent surface markers
- Works on reflective PCB surfaces
- High spatial resolution (`<50 µm`)
- Real-time strain monitoring capability

**Implementation:**
- Coherent laser illumination
- High-speed camera capture (`>100 fps`)
- Speckle contrast analysis algorithms
- Temporal and spatial filtering

## Measurement Parameters

### Thermal Analysis
- **Temperature Mapping**: IR imaging of thermal hotspots
- **Thermal Stress Calculation**: Strain due to coefficient of thermal expansion mismatch
- **Transient Response**: Strain evolution during thermal cycling
- **Component Interaction**: Stress transfer between components and substrate

### Mechanical Analysis
- **Bending Strain**: Curvature-induced strain from component loading
- **Shear Strain**: Interfaces between components and PCB
- **Principal Stresses**: Major and minor stress orientations
- **Failure Prediction**: Areas approaching material yield limits

## Experimental Procedure

### Sample Preparation
1. **Surface Preparation**: Clean PCB surface for optical imaging
2. **Speckle Application**: Apply random speckle pattern or use natural features
3. **Boundary Markers**: Define region of interest for measurement
4. **Mounting**: Secure PCB in thermal chamber with minimal constraint

### Test Execution
1. **Baseline Image**: Capture reference image at room temperature
2. **Thermal Cycling**: Apply temperature ramps (±ΔT at controlled rate)
3. **Continuous Imaging**: Capture images at each temperature step
4. **Load Application**: Optional mechanical loading for stress testing
5. **Data Logging**: Record timestamps and environmental parameters

### Data Analysis
1. **Image Registration**: Align sequential images for displacement calculation
2. **Strain Calculation**: Compute strain tensor components
3. **Filtering**: Apply smoothing to reduce noise
4. **Visualization**: Generate strain maps and thermal plots
5. **Statistical Analysis**: Extract quantitative metrics and failure regions

## Key Findings

### Thermal Hotspots Identified
- High-power component areas show 3-5x higher strain
- Thermal gradients cause non-uniform stress distribution
- Solder joint areas experience maximum shear strain

### Mechanical Response
